# Introduction

`fluent-vue` is an internationalization plugin for [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org). It's a Vue.js integration for [Fluent.js](https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent.js) - JavaScript implementation of [Project Fluent](https://projectfluent.org).

`fluent-vue` API is inspired by [vue-i18n](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n). But API surface is much smaller as most things are handled by Fluent syntax.

Fluent keeps simple things simple and makes complex things possible. The syntax used for describing translations is easy to read and understand. At the same time it allows, when necessary, to represent complex concepts from natural languages like gender, plurals, conjugations, and others. Read the [Fluent Syntax Guide](https://www.projectfluent.org/fluent/guide/) to learn more about the syntax.
